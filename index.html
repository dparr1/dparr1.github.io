    <p>I am currently a Senior Lecturer of Geography and Geospatial Sciences in the 
      Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Metropolitan State University of Denver. 
      I teach classes in GIS, programming, web mapping, spatial databases, cartography, 
      spatial modeling and analysis, data acquisition and integration.</p>

   <p>I see my disciplines, Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Spatial Data 
     Science as the intersections of Geography and Computer Science from which I 
     have earned my degrees. Therefore, I want students to be able to think geographically 
     that is, to critically consider the dynamic spatial and temporal issues of a problem 
     and to consider how scale and distance impact our human and physical environments. 
     I also want them to think computationally that is, to break problems into smaller 
     components in a logical sequence and consider how a representation in a computer 
     is related to the object in the real world. These skills understanding spatial 
     relations and logical problem solving are critical skills in our discipline and 
     in the wider world.</p>

     
     <p>My teaching and research interests include Volunteered Geographic Information, 
       Space-Time Spatial Analysis and Modeling, GIS and Geography Education, and GIS 
       and Society including Digital Places and Web GIS.</p>
